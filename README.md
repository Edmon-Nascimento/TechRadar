# TechRadar – Tech Jobs Radar

TechRadar is a web application built to practice API consumption, component modularization, and scalable front-end architecture.  
The platform fetches and displays remote tech job listings using the Remotive Jobs API, providing a clean and organized interface for exploring opportunities.

This project was developed as part of my continuous improvement as a front-end developer, with a strong focus on structure, responsibility separation, and maintainable code.

## Project Purpose

The main goals of this project were:

- Practice consuming external APIs
- Strengthen modular architecture in React
- Improve TypeScript usage for safer and predictable code
- Work with reusable components
- Structure a scalable front-end project

Rather than building a complex system, the focus was on applying fundamentals correctly and building with intention.

## What I Practiced

This project helped reinforce:

- API consumption with Axios  
- Handling asynchronous data  
- Type modeling for external APIs  
- Component modularization  
- Clean project organization  
- Separation of concerns in React  


It represents my commitment to evolving from front-end development toward full-stack capability, focusing on strong architectural foundations.
